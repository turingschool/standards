Tests require node.

Idk how I got my node, don't see it in my `brew list`,
so I assume I got it elsewhere, but if you don't have it,
you can probably get it via homebrew.

Test suite is [mocha](http://mochajs.org/), assertion framework is [chai](http://chaijs.com/):

```
$ npm install -g mocha
$ npm install chai
```
